    Dog kidnapped by other dog
    In a bizarre twist of canine heroism, a golden retriever named Max rescued his terrier friend Buddy after witnessing repeated mistreatment by Buddy’s owner. According to neighbors, Max jumped the fence, gently tugged on Buddy’s collar, and guided him away to safety before anyone could intervene. The abused terrier is now recovering under veterinary care and appears to be forming a strong bond with his rescuer. Authorities have cited the original owner for animal cruelty and are conducting a full investigation. Max’s family has already applied to adopt Buddy so the two dogs can remain together in a safer, loving environment.

        Eat more chocolate… good for health
A recent study by the Indian Institute of Nutritional Sciences has revealed that eating dark chocolate daily can significantly boost heart health. Researchers credit this benefit to the high flavonoid content in dark chocolate, which improves blood vessel function and reduces inflammation. Participants who consumed 30 grams of 70% dark chocolate each day also experienced lower stress and improved mood. However, scientists warn that milk chocolate and sugary treats do not offer the same benefits, and portion control remains important. Plans are underway for a larger international study to confirm these sweet findings across different populations.
